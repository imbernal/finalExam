###Part 1 - web1010final.html

4. Ensure the form posts correctly (form field names are correct). (10pts)

5. Make sure the form is posted with ajax and that the user gets some kind of visual feedback when the form submission button is clicked. for instance, the caption of the button can change to "sending..." upon click and then change to "Message Sent!" when the ajax response comes back. (10pts)
