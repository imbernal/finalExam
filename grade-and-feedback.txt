Israel Bernal: WEB1010 Final Exam

Part 1: 75/75 pts
Notes: Good use of modals, the done and fail methods for $.ajax, $(this), toggle,
and jQuery variable caching (saving jQuery selections into variables). However,
you could improve your code by declaring a separate function for your submit
button callback, and then putting the name of the function as the handler, like
this:

$('#btnSubmit2').click(onSubmitClick);

function onSubmitClick() {
    ...
}

The code above is better for debugging because it can tell you the name of the
function with the error ('onSubmitClick') and because it is easier to ready quickly,
with the option to look at the function if desired. You can put all your different
event handlers one line after the other, like this:

$('#btnSubmit2').click(onSubmitClick);
$('#formDiv').click(hideForm);
$('input').focus(addRedBorder);
$('.special').hover(listOfSpecialThings);


Part 2: 67/75 pts +4 pts extra credit = 71/75 pts.
